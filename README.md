## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Python, Pygame

Using Python and Pygame, I was able to create a replica of flappy bird, Pygame's library makes it easy to create game states, sprites and controls for the characters. This Project used a tutorial by "Clear Code" with heavy modifications, the tutorial can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY9MnQ4x3zk

## Lessons Learned:

This project was created as a means to recap for programming within python, as I had not done it since May 2024. This project was a test of my ability of PyGame and Python as a whole.
